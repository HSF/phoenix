# Phoenix

Phoenix is a TypeScript-based event display framework, using the popular [three.js](https://threejs.org) library for 3D. It focuses on being experiment agnostic by design, with common tools (such as custom menus, controls, propagators) and the possibility to add experiment specific extensions.

It consists of two packages: a plain TypeScript core library ([phoenix-event-display](./packages/phoenix-event-display/README.md)) and Angular example application ([phoenix-ng](./packages/phoenix-ng/README.md)). A React example is also [provided](https://github.com/9inpachi/phoenix-react). The core library can be adapted for any experiment with some simple steps.

Phoenix is supported by the [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org) and is the official web event display of the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern).

It was selected for Google Summer of Code support in 2019, 2020 and 2021.

You can see the stable version at [https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/phoenix](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/phoenix/) and the development version at [http://phoenix-dev.surge.sh](http://phoenix-dev.surge.sh).

## Demo

[![Phoenix demo](https://raw.github.com/HSF/phoenix/master/packages/phoenix-ng/projects/phoenix-app/src/assets/images/video-cover.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETtkZ-mnzgQ)

## Packages

* [`phoenix-event-display`](./packages/phoenix-event-display/)  
  Phoenix event display framework
* [`phoenix-ng`](./packages/phoenix-ng/)  
  Phoenix Angular application

## Development

For running both the event display and the Angular app, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and Yarn.

Once you have Node.js and npm (npm comes with Node.js), install Yarn.

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

> You might need to set your Yarn version to Yarn 2 and beyond with
> ```
> yarn set version berry
> ```

Then run the following commands.

```sh
# Install all the required dependencies
yarn install
# For macOS Ventura you may need to specify C++ version, e.g. yarn install -std=c++17

# Run phoenix-event-display and phoenix-app in development/watch mode
yarn start
```

Now both the `phoenix-event-display` and `phoenix-app` will start in development/watch mode. Any changes made to the `phoenix-event-display` will rebuild and hot reload the `phoenix-app`. You can access the app by navigating to [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200) on the browser.

## Docker

Run the following Docker command to start Phoenix locally using Docker.

```sh
docker run -dp 80:80 9inpachi/phoenix
```

Access the app by navigating to [`http://localhost`](http://localhost) on the browser.

## Phoenix presentations

Phoenix was presented at the [HSF/WLCG virtual workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941278/contributions/4084836/) and the presentation can be watched on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFvlf9TpyEc&t=347s)

## Examples of Phoenix in use

### ATLAS
[PhoenixATLAS](https://github.com/ATLAS-experiment/PhoenixATLAS) is the official web event display of the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern). It can be used to visualise different versions of ATLAS Geometry, and uploaded events.

ATLAS has also used it for embedded events in Physics briefings, e.g. [Heavyweight champions: a search for new heavy W' bosons with the ATLAS detector](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi5vtnp8Yr8AhWw9LsIHeSPBRoQFnoECCAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fatlas.cern%2Fupdates%2Fbriefing%2Fsearch-heavy-W-bosons&usg=AOvVaw3RpPlPkM5i4gdk2S27cX-C)

### FCC
Phoenix is also used by [Future Circular Collider](https://fcc.web.cern.ch), see [here](https://fccsw.web.cern.ch/fccsw/phoenix/).

### LHCb
Phoenix is also used by [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch), see [here](https://lhcb-eventdisplay.web.cern.ch/)
