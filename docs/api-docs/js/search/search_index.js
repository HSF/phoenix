display that uses three.js for processing and presenting detector geometry and event data.\nTo use in your application, install the package.\nExample :npm install phoenix-event-display\n# or\nyarn add phoenix-event-displayUsage\nAs a module\nTo create a simple event display.\nExample :// Import required classes\nimport { EventDisplay, PhoenixLoader } from 'phoenix-event-display';\n\n// Create the

script along with three.js. You can either use the CDN or build from source.\nTo build Phoenix as a bundle.\nExample :yarn build:bundleThis will generate a file phoenix.min.js in the ./dist/bundle directory which can be included in your HTML code.\nWithout building, you can include the bundle directly from CDN.\nExample :\n  \n    ...\n  \n\n  \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n      // Create the event display\n      const
