your application, install the package.\nExample :npm install phoenix-event-display\n# or\nyarn add phoenix-event-displayUsage\nAs a module\nTo create a simple event display.\nExample :// Import required classes\nimport { EventDisplay, PhoenixLoader } from 'phoenix-event-display';\n\n// Create the event display\nconst eventDisplay = new EventDisplay();\n\n// Define the configuration\nconst configuration = {\n  elementId: '',\n  eventDataLoader: new PhoenixLoader(), // or some other event data loader\n  // ... other configuration options\n};\n\n// Initialize the event display with the

bundle\nPhoenix can be bundled and used directly in the HTML as a script along with three.js. You can either use the CDN or build from source.\nTo build Phoenix as a bundle.\nExample :yarn build:bundleThis will generate a file phoenix.min.js in the ./dist/bundle directory which can be included in your HTML code.\nWithout building, you can include the bundle directly from CDN.\nExample :\n  \n    ...\n  \n\n  \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n      // Create the event display\n      const
