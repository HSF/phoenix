The data should be as detector-agnostic as possible.\nTechnically the 3D is done with three.js, the menu (at the moment) uses DAT.GUI and the data format is just plain JSON.\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.3.4.\nYou can see an online version at https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/phoenix/\nBuild and install\nThis is an Angular application, so you will need to have Node js and Angular CLI installed locally.\nYou can follow this guide to set up your local environment.\nOnce everything is set up, run ng serve from the command line in the project directory for a dev server. Then navigate to http://localhost:4200/ from your browser. \nThe app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nDocumentation\n\nUser manual.\nHow to contribute.\nDeveloper guide.\n\nContact\nThis is still very much a work in progress, so let me know of any problems (and don't be too surprised if there are some).\nedward.moyse@cern.ch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
